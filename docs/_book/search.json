The newest attraction of fruits bats includes the muubat, one of the friendliest and meek bat species to interact with. In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats. To garner attention to the newest attraction, Fuchsia City advertised that the muubats should be fully integrated into the Safari Zone by the summertime.",

    "text": "2.2 Standard Protocol:\nAny new animal that has been chosen to be integrated into the Safari Zone must undergo certain testing, training, and other procedures before being integrated into the wild. Unfortunately, the risks with muubats, like all bat species, is that they tend to harbor many different viral diseases that cause nasty infections in humans. It is protocol when introducing new bat species, as well as many other animal species, to test the animal for any known diseases, both bacterial and viral, that could cause spillover into humans and the other animals. Oftentimes the presence of a microorganism in an animal is confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, which detects the presence of different microbes that can cause disease. As the advent of whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and its utility is very much new to the city’s surveillance methods, work is still ongoing to be able to detect novel pathogens which have not been previously encountered before.",

    "text": "2.3 Testing the muubats:\nAs soon as the muubats arrive to the facility they are physically examined and tested. Blood samples and swab samples are taken per individual bat, and are subjected to bacterial culture, and a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel. Culture from blood samples generally takes 48 to 72 hours, and according to the results, none of the blood samples from any of the four bats produced viable colonies. Any leftover blood samples were stored for potential future uses. For the swab samples, genetic material is extracted from the swabs, and then prepped for sequencing. The turn-around time for sequencing to bioinformatics takes about a week and a half. The muubats are kept in an isolated environment interacting only with the trainers during their time in quarantine. It is protocol to obtain enough swab samples for which the extracts could be stored, so both additional and leftover extracts were stored in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer for potential future uses. After a week and a half, the taxonomic identification results from the pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel came back negative, indicating that none of the bats carried any known pathogens that caused infections in humans. With testing and sequencing indicating that the muubats appeared to be clear and healthy, the fruit bats were then relocated to another facility area to begin training.",

Animals that exhibited symptoms of fever, lethargy, and lack of appetite, were immediately swabbed and tested for flu. Typically, the residents that were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms would drop by the clinics for testing to receive the proper treatment for their illness. While few people tested positive for flu, most individuals and animals tested negative for flu. Doctors and animal trainers speculated that there must be a new pathogen spreading around the city and wildlife that’s not easily able to be detected using their known testing and sequencing protocols. After meeting to discuss the next course of action, doctors and animal trainers decided to collect and keep as many swab samples as possible to see if the Regional Health Laboratory would have the capacity to identify the pathogen in the samples.",

A team of Genomics Specialists were assigned to investigate the city-wide and wildlife outbreak, including Microbiologists that specialized in laboratory methods and sequencing, Bioinformaticians that specialized in genome assembly and genomic analyses, and Molecular Epidemiologists that specialized in hypothesis testing, genomic analysis interpretation, and visualization.
