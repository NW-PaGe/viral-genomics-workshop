# Fuchsia City begins collecting...

**Fuchsia City begins collecting swab samples from the animals, workers, and residents:**

Upon the closing of the Safari Zone, the city set up flu testing for the animals and the residents. Animals that exhibited symptoms of fever, lethargy, and lack of appetite, were immediately swabbed and tested for flu. Typically, the residents that were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms would drop by the clinics for testing to receive the proper treatment for their illness. While few people tested positive for flu, most individuals and animals tested negative for flu. Doctors and animal trainers speculated that there must be a new pathogen spreading around the city and wildlife thatâ€™s not easily able to be detected using their known testing and sequencing protocols. After meeting to discuss the next course of action, doctors and animal trainers decided to collect and keep as many swab samples as possible to see if the Regional Health Laboratory would have the capacity to identify the pathogen in the samples. 

## Discussion Two:

Based on the population size and structure, describe a sampling scheme that you think would best fit this outbreak scenario.
