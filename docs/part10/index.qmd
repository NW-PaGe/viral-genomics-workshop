# Genomic Analysis

The team met to discuss what kind of genomic analyses could be performed to help visualize the sequencing data of the outbreak. Members suggested constructing a phylogenetic tree and pairwise distance matrix to understand the relationship between sequences. The team agreed that a tree and pairwise distance matrix would be helpful to get a sense of how related and similar the sequences were. The Molecular Epidemiologists set off to construct a phylogenetic tree and a pairwise distance matrix.

## Discussion Twelve:
A. Looking at the phylogenetic tree, what inferences would you make regarding the placement of the samples on the tree?


B. Is the phylogenetic tree in congruence with the exposure map?



C. Looking at the heatmap, do you notice any clusters or patterns that match how the sequences are placed on the tree?



D. What would you conclude from this analysis? Does this analysis support your hypothesis?
