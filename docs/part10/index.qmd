# Genomic Analysis

The team met to discuss what kind of genomic analyses could be performed to help visualize the sequencing data of the outbreak. While the MSA shows us exactly where genetic differences occur in the sequences, a phylogenetic tree summarizes those differences into a branching diagram that helps us trace the virus’s evolutionary history and how it may have spread from host to host. They decided to construct a pairwise distance matrix and a phylogenetic tree using the sequencing alignment. The pairwise distance matrix and phylogenetic tree are examples of two essential tools in genomic epidemiology. These analyses would allow them to determine how closely related viral genomes were, whether the outbreak originated from an animal spillover event, and how the virus was evolving over time.

Sequences Aligned:

Ref:   ATGCTGATCGTACGTTACG
Seq A: ATGCTGATCGTACGTTACG  (No mutations)
Seq B: ATGCTGATCGTACGTCACG  (1 mutation at pos 16: T → C)
Seq C: ATGCTGATCGTTCGTCACG  (2 mutations at pos 12: A → T, 16: T → C)
Seq D: ATGCTGATTGTACGTCACG  (3 mutations at pos 9: C → T, 12: A → T, 16: T → C)
Seq E: ATGCTGATTGTACGTTACG  (2 mutations at pos 9: C → T, 12: A → T)
```

"Uhm", raised the hand of one of the Local Health Jurisdiction Epidemiologists. "I understand alignments after looking at the sequence alignment results the Bioinformaticians generated. But I am a bit rusty when it comes to pairwise distance matries and phylogenetic trees. Perhaps one of you could explain it to me?"

"Sure thing", exclaimed one of the Molecular Epidemiologists. Let's start with pairwise distance matrices.

## Pairwise Distance Matrices
A pairwise distance matrix is a table that quantifies the *genetic differences between sequences* by counting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPS are individual base differences at specific nucleotide posititions in the genome. It helps to determine how closely related two samples are and whether genetic clustering aligns with known epidemiological links.

Each cell in the matrix represents the *number of SNP differences* between a pair of genome sequences. The smaller the number, the more similar the sequences are. A value of 0 means the sequences are identical.

Computing pairwise distance matrices is a relatively straightfoward process with several steps. First the sequence are aligned (or arranged to where the sequences line up together). In this case, each viral genome would be aligned to the reference genome to detect differences in nucleotide positions. Next, one would count the SNP differences. Each genome is compared and the number of nucleotide differences are counted. This produces a matrix where *row = column* (since sequence A vs B is the same as B vs A). Lastly, heatmaps can be generated from the matrices to give a visual representation using a color scheme. 

**Example illustrating a Pairwise Distance Matrix** 
```
| Sample ID   | Ref  | Seq A | Seq B | Seq C | Seq D | Seq E |
|-------------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Ref         | 0    | 0     |  1    |  2    |  3    |  2    |
| Seq A       | 0    | 0     |  1    |  2    |  3    |  2    |
| Seq B       | 1    | 1     |  0    |  1    |  2    |  3    |
| Seq C       | 2    | 2     |  1    |  0    |  1    |  2    |
| Seq D       | 3    | 3     |  2    |  1    |  0    |  1    |
| Seq E       | 2    | 2     |  3    |  2    |  1    |  0    |
```

"I see now, thank you so much! That makes sense." Smiled the Local Health Jurisdiction Epidemiologist.

Another Molecular Epidemiologist chimed in, "I am happy to explain phylogenetic trees!"

## Phylogenetic Trees
A phylogenetic tree is a hierarchical clustering or branching diagram that represents the evolutionary relationships between sequences based on genetic similarity. In this outbreak investigation, the tree helps determine how closely related viral genomes are across different individuals and species. Think of it as a family tree where we can trace the ancestry of a virus.

Each *tip (or leaf)* on the tree represents a sample's genome sequence of the virus. The branches connecting them indicate evolutionary relationships, or the sharing of a common ancestor, and branch length represent the amount of genetic difference between sequences. 

When interpreting trees, there's so much to consider! Yet, let's keep it simple and expand on the concept of a "family tree" with sequences being "closely related". Samples that are closer together along the x-axis being *more genetically similar* and *genetically related to each other*. Shorter branch lengths indicate *fewer genetic differences between sequences*, meaning that there's less mutations between the sequences and they share a more recent common ancestor. However, longer branches means an accumulation of more mutations. As such, this would mean that the sequences are less closely related or are distantly related. Identical sequences would occur along the same x-axis but would be stacked vertically on the y-axis for visibility.

**Example illustrating phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment**
```
          ┌── Seq A (identical to Ref)
     ┌────┤
     │    └── Seq B (1 SNP)
─────┤
     │        ┌── Seq C (2 SNPs)
     │    ┌───┤
     │    │   └── Seq D (3 SNPs)
     └────┤
          └── Seq E (2 SNPs)

```

"I see now" said the Local Health Jursidiction Epidemiologist. "Thank you so much for explaining! I imagine the process to generate the trees requires some form of computation?"

"Absolutely!" cheered the Molecular Epidemiologist. I'm happy to explain that as well.

### Generating Phylogenetic Trees
Once the genome sequences are aligned and mutations identified, the next step is to construct a phylogenetic tree, a visual representation of their evolutionary relationships.

The first step in building the tree is to calculate genetic distances—essentially counting how many nucleotide differences separated each sequence. Viral sequences that shared fewer mutations are likely part of the same transmission chain, while those with more mutations were more genetically distinct.

To translate these genetic distances into a tree, we can use computational clustering algorithms that groups sequences based on similarity. The general process follows these steps: First we generate our sequence alignment in which all genome sequences were compared letter by letter to pinpoint mutations. Next we compute our distance matrix in which the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating each pair of sequences is counted. This would generate a pairwise distance matrix that quantified genetic differences between samples. 

Afterwards, a tree would be constructed using a clustering algorithm. There's quite a few different clustering algorithm, but what they do is group sequences that are genetically similar into clusters, forming a branching structure - a sort of *family tree*.

The final tree would reveal key insights about the outbreak. "Given the outbreak, if sequences from the muubats and infected trainers clustered closely together, it would provide strong evidence of spillover from animals to humans" explained one of the Molecular Epidemiologist. "Alternatively, if human sequences showed signs of divergence, it might suggest ongoing transmission within the human population", they continued.

*Line list of cases in outbreak.*
The line list shows the sample IDs of the sequenced cases in the outbreak. The second column shows the collection date of the samples collected from the case in year-month-day format. The third column shows the exposure notes collected from the case interviews conducted during the outbreak investigation. Unfortunately some of the cases, such as the residents, could not be reached. Some information remains incomplete for the workers as some workers tend to work in different areas, and are involved in different responsibilities when it comes to taking care of the animals and the park.

*Phylogenetic Tree of Outbreak.*
This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships between sequences from the outbreak. The tips on the tree represent individual genome sequences of the virus, which are color-coded by species in relation to the park.
The x-axis represents divergence (also sometimes referred to as genetic distance, or the number of mutations from the reference genome). To give an example, the reference genome is 5000 bases long, so a divergence of 0.0006 would mean 3 mutations difference. (5000 * 0.0006).

Note that identical sequences like muubat_02, muubat_03, and muubat_04 lie on the same x-axis and are stacked vertically. Comparing the muubat sequences with the sequences of the residents, the branch length of the resident is much longer indicating that the viruses that infected the muubats are less closely related to the residents.

![Exposure Map of Animals, Trainers, and Workers](../images/case_mapping.jpeg)

*Exposure Map.*
The exposure map uses information from the case interview to piece together how animals, trainers, and workers might be linked together in the outbreak. Lines indicate that the case was either *exposed to* or *had an interaction with* the other cases or animals. 


![Heatmap of SNP Distances of Sequences in Outbreak](../images/heatmap14.jpeg)

*Heatmap.*
The heatmap shows the pairwise distance between two sequences. The pairwise distance is given by the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single base difference between two sequences. The range of SNP differences for the sequenced cases in the outbreak is 0 to 9. A SNP distnace of 0 (darkest color) means that two sequences are identical, while a higher SNP count (lighter color) indicates greater genetic divergence. Comparing this heatmap with the phylogenetic tree helps confirm whether clusters of closely related sequences correspond to expected epidemiological links. Sequences that are darker in color indicate fewer SNP differences between the two sequences, whereas lighter color indicates more SNP differences between the two cases. 

## Interpretating the Results
"Let's take some time to review the results. We should each try to come up with our own interpretations and then compare to see what seems to be best explained by the data." 

The phylogenetic tree revealed patterns in the genetic relationship between the sequences generated from each sample. Some sequences clustered more closely together whereas others showed greated divergence. Meanwhile, the SNP heatmap highlighted key genetic differences, with certain sequences appearing more similar while others displayed increasing variation over time. The team deliberated: what might these patterns suggest about how the virus spread and changed throughout the outbreak?

## Discussion Twelve:
A. Looking at the phylogenetic tree, what inferences would you make regarding the placement of the samples on the tree?


B. Is the phylogenetic tree in congruence with the exposure map?



C. Looking at the heatmap, do you notice any clusters or patterns that match how the sequences are placed on the tree?



D. What would you conclude from this analysis? Does this analysis support your hypothesis?
