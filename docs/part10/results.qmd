*Line list of cases in outbreak.*
The line list shows the sample IDs of the sequenced cases in the outbreak. The second column shows the collection date of the samples collected from the case in year-month-day format. The third column shows the exposure notes collected from the case interviews conducted during the outbreak investigation. Unfortunately some of the cases, such as the residents, could not be reached. Some information remains incomplete for the workers as some workers tend to work in different areas, and are involved in different responsibilities when it comes to taking care of the animals and the park.

*Phylogenetic Tree of Outbreak.*
This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships between sequences from the outbreak. The tips on the tree represent individual genome sequences of the virus, which are color-coded by species in relation to the park.
The x-axis represents divergence (also sometimes referred to as genetic distance, or the number of mutations from the reference genome). To give an example, the reference genome is 5000 bases long, so a divergence of 0.0006 would mean 3 mutations difference. (5000 * 0.0006).

Note that identical sequences like muubat_02, muubat_03, and muubat_04 lie on the same x-axis and are stacked vertically. Comparing the muubat sequences with the sequences of the residents, the branch length of the resident is much longer indicating that the viruses that infected the muubats are less closely related to the residents.

![Exposure Map of Animals, Trainers, and Workers](../images/case_mapping.jpeg)

*Exposure Map.*
The exposure map uses information from the case interview to piece together how animals, trainers, and workers might be linked together in the outbreak. Lines indicate that the case was either *exposed to* or *had an interaction with* the other cases or animals. 


![Heatmap of SNP Distances of Sequences in Outbreak](../images/heatmap14.jpeg)

*Heatmap.*
The heatmap shows the pairwise distance between two sequences. The pairwise distance is given by the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single base difference between two sequences. The range of SNP differences for the sequenced cases in the outbreak is 0 to 9. A SNP distnace of 0 (darkest color) means that two sequences are identical, while a higher SNP count (lighter color) indicates greater genetic divergence. Comparing this heatmap with the phylogenetic tree helps confirm whether clusters of closely related sequences correspond to expected epidemiological links. Sequences that are darker in color indicate fewer SNP differences between the two sequences, whereas lighter color indicates more SNP differences between the two cases. 

## Interpreting the Results
"Let's take some time to review the results. We should each try to come up with our own interpretations and then compare to see what seems to be best explained by the data." 

The phylogenetic tree revealed patterns in the genetic relationship between the sequences generated from each sample. Some sequences clustered more closely together whereas others showed greated divergence. Meanwhile, the SNP heatmap highlighted key genetic differences, with certain sequences appearing more similar while others displayed increasing variation over time. The team deliberated: what might these patterns suggest about how the virus spread and changed throughout the outbreak?

## Discussion Twelve: Interpreting Phylogenetic Trees

A. Looking at the phylogenetic tree, what inferences would you make regarding the placement of the samples on the tree?


B. Is the phylogenetic tree in congruence with the exposure map?



C. Looking at the heatmap, do you notice any clusters or patterns that match how the sequences are placed on the tree?



D. What would you conclude from this analysis? Does this analysis support your hypothesis?
