    <label for="question1">Looking at the phylogenetic tree, what would you expect to see if the virus originated from a single introduction into humans?</label><br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer1" name="question1" value="A"> A. All human sequences would be identical.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer2" name="question1" value="B"> B. Human sequences would cluster closely together (or group closely together) but differ slightly.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer3" name="question1" value="C"> C. Human sequences would be widely dispersed (or scattered) throughout the tree.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer4" name="question1" value="D"> D. Human sequences would be more similar to environmental microbes than to each other.<br>
