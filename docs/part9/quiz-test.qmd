    <label for="question1">What is the primary reason scientists use multiple sequence alignments (MSA) in outbreak investigations?</label><br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer1" name="question1" value="A"> A. To identify differences between sequences and formulate hypotheses on reconstructing transmission patterns.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer2" name="question1" value="B"> B. To determine if a virus is more closely related to bacteria or fungi.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer3" name="question1" value="C"> C. To verify that all samples contain complete genomes before analyses.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer4" name="question1" value="D"> D. To directly confirm how a virus spreads between individuals.<br>

Multiple sequence alignments help scientists compare genetic sequences to detect mutations, track viral evolution, and formulate hypotheses on transmission pathways. What do you think? Do you think by analyzing aligned sequences researchers can determine the quality of the genome and if the virus is changing over time? Do you think we would see patterns that may help to speculate if cases are genomicly linked? " : "Incorrect. Think carefully!";
