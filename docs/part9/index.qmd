# QC Checks 

**Sequence quality checks prior to genomic analysis:**

Prior to genomic analysis, the Bioinformaticians and Molecular Epidemiologists worked together to generate a multiple sequence alignment of all of the sequences they had obtained so far. Once the multiple sequence alignment was finished, the team visually inspected the quality of the sequences as well as noted any similarities or differences.

*Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Metrics of Sequences in Alignment Viewer.*
The alignment file containing sequences from the outbreak aligned to the reference genome was analyzed in Alignment Viewer. Alignment Viewer shows the percentage of gaps in the genome, representing any ambiguity or incomplete coverage across the genome. **ident1%** and **ident2%** compares the reference sequence with a sequence from the outbreak. Both metrics indicate degree of genetic similarity of the two sequences. **ident1%** is the fraction of reference sequence identical to the second sequence, whereas **ident2%** is the fraction of the second sequence identical to the reference sequence. 


## Discussion Ten: 

Looking at the table above, what do you notice about the genetic identity shared among the sequences with each other, as well as the reference? Do these genomes look complete?

The MSA using NCBI Alignment Viewer are shown above. Part A shows the coverage and mutations across the genome, whereas part B shows coverage across the spike gene. Mutations at a base position is indicated by the red lines.


## Dicussion Eleven:

A. Looking at the multiple sequence alignment, what would you infer about the appearance of the mutations and where they are occurring? 


B. Are most mutations occurring within a specific region of the genome? If so, why do you think that might be the case?
