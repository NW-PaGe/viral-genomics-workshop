# The molecular investigation begins:

The Molecular Epidemiologists were tasked with working with the Zoonotic Epidemiology Team and Local Health Epidemiologists to develop hypotheses related to the underlying cause and source of the outbreak, as well as working with the Bioinformaticians to ensure the proper analyses were performed related to hypothesis testing and performing any additional analyses if necessary. To better understand the outbreak, the Genomics team met to discuss what it is that they understood about the outbreak and came up with a list of observations. The team also began constructing a series of interview questions for the outbreak investigation.

## Discussion Five:

Field epidemiology applications during outbreak investigations typically employ case interviews to determine risk factors, transmission, source exposures. Describe the types of questions that would be essential to ask cases to formulate hypotheses regarding the initial source of the outbreak. What kind of information do you think we would need in order to get an idea of potential risk factors, transmissions, and source exposure?
