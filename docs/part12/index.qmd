# Conclusion:

Overtime the novel virus had come to be known as the Muutuvirus, aptly named for its initial identification in the muutubats. The Genomic Specialists Team, along with many Public Health Professionals around the region worked tirelessly to contain the epidemic as much as possible, and eventually the Muutuvirus became a mild and seasonal flu-like virus that caused no deaths in the population. The muubats at the Safari Zone appeared to be cleared of the muutuvirus after much testing and was able to be fully integrated into the wild. The following year, everything returned to normal as much as possible, and Fuchsia City Safari Zone finally opened its doors to tourists again. Many tourists were finally able to see the muubats in nature, and everyone lived peacefully ever after. 


**Fin!**

## Discussion Fourteen:

The outbreak was eventually contained, but what if the virus had not been detected in time? What other steps could have been taken to prevent a spillover event like this in the future?
