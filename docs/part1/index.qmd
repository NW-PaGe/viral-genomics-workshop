# We begin...

*In the bustling city of Fuchsia, a mysterious illness began spreading in the late winter of 2031. What started as an isolated flu-like sickness among trainers soon spiraled into a full-blown outbreak, baffling doctors and scientists alike. But the real mystery? The source of the infection remained completely unknown. As scientists scrambled to sequence the pathogen's genome, an unsettling possibility emerged: Could this virus have been silently lurking among the Safari Zone in the city long before anyone could have even gotten sick?*

**We begin our outbreak mystery with the city's history:**

The fictional city of Fuchsia City is home to a population of about a million people and rests amid a Safari Zone. The Safari Zone, constructed many hundreds of years ago, is home to many docile wildlife that have learned to live in coexistence with humans. Living in the forests of the Safari Zone are many different species of friendly canines, always running playfully amuck in groups, different feline species, some of which are cunning, curious, and mischievous, and small bears, known for their soft fur and sheer laziness. The canines, felines, and small bears only make up a portion of the animal population; you can also find deer, bulls, kangaroos, a variety of bird species, both small and large, (including the famous ducklings!), pikas of varying sizes, and many diverse insects, of which includes the many diverse species of butterflies.

Due to the docile nature of the animals, many tourists from all over would come visit the Fuchsia City Safari Zone to interact with the animals. From time-to-time animals with potential docile natures are introduced to the Safari Zone but are fully trained by expert animal trainers before being integrated into the wild.

## The newest attraction:

The Safari Zone is also home to many fruit bat species that you can find hanging about in the fruit trees and caves hidden within the mountains. The newest attraction of fruits bats includes the muubat, one of the friendliest and meek bat species to interact with. In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats. To garner attention to the newest attraction, Fuchsia City advertised that the muubats should be fully integrated into the Safari Zone by the summertime.

## Standard Protocol:

Any new animal that has been chosen to be integrated into the Safari Zone must undergo certain testing, training, and other procedures before being integrated into the wild. Unfortunately, the risks with muubats, like all bat species, is that they tend to harbor many different viral diseases that cause nasty infections in humans. It is protocol when introducing new bat species, as well as many other animal species, to test the animal for any known diseases, both bacterial and viral, that could cause spillover into humans and the other animals. Oftentimes the presence of a microorganism in an animal is confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, which detects the presence of different microbes that can cause disease. As the advent of whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and its utility is very much new to the city's surveillance methods, work is still ongoing to be able to detect novel pathogens which have not been previously encountered before.

## Testing the muubats:

As soon as the muubats arrive to the facility they are physically examined and tested. Blood samples and swab samples are taken per individual bat, and are subjected to bacterial culture, and a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel. Culture from blood samples generally takes 48 to 72 hours, and according to the results, none of the blood samples from any of the four bats produced viable colonies. Any leftover blood samples were stored for potential future uses. For the swab samples, genetic material is extracted from the swabs, and then prepped for sequencing. The turn-around time for sequencing to bioinformatics takes about a week and a half. The muubats are kept in an isolated environment interacting only with the trainers during their time in quarantine. It is protocol to obtain enough swab samples for which the extracts could be stored, so both additional and leftover extracts were stored in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer for potential future uses. After a week and a half, the taxonomic identification results from the pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel came back negative, indicating that none of the bats carried any known pathogens that caused infections in humans. With testing and sequencing indicating that the muubats appeared to be clear and healthy, the fruit bats were then relocated to another facility area to begin training.

# The winter season of respiratory illnesses begin:

The muubats arrived in the Safari Zone facilities in mid-December of 2030. Come January of 2031, the fruits bats were doing well adapting to the new humans and environments. At the beginning of January many of the trainers for the muubats went to a week-long conference to present on how well the bats were doing with training and adapting to the environment. However, on the third day, a mystery flu-like illness started to sweep through the conference. This illness was accompanied with symptoms like fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuff nose, muscle and body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some individuals even experienced diarrhea. Five of the eight Muubats trainers started to come down with the illness as well. On the fourth day of the conference, three people were confirmed to have flu and may have been the source of the outbreak. At this point in time many people have come down with an illness and so the final days of the conference were cancelled. 

The muubat trainers thought it was in their best interest to fly back to Fuchsia City, so despite most of them being sick, they all masked up and traveled back home. Upon arrival, three of the trainers decided to quarantine under the assumption that they had flu but opted out on getting any tests done. The three seemingly healthy trainers returned to work immediately. Two of the trainers said that they felt so ill that they decided to go up to the lab to get tested. 

The two trainers went to the Safari Zone lab to get tested, but to their surprise the tests came back negative for flu. Unlike flu, which typically resolves within a week or two, this illness seemed to linger. Some trainers continued experiencing fatigue, cough, and body aches for nearly a month. Even after their fever subsided, they remained sluggish and unwell. Strangely, follow up testing showed high viral load indicating the possibility that the trainers might still be infectious and contagious for over three weeks, even when symptoms begin to subside.

Doctors assumed it was probably some other respiratory pathogen that they did not test for and decided to keep their swab samples for future use. The trainers were told to quarantine for the next few days until they were feeling better. Several weeks later the five trainers were feeling better enough to return to work.

# The flu-like illness continues to spread into late winter:

As winter progressed, the news of the rise of a flu-like illness began to stream across many of the news sources. A flu-like illness swept across the region, and doctors feared that this was the worst flu season yet. As people began to test and seek treatment for the flu, doctors were discovering that many of the individuals that were presenting with flu-like symptoms were not testing positive for flu. Although there were many individuals that were testing positive for flu, there were also many individuals that were negative for all respiratory pathogens. 

Upon hearing that the flu season was devastating this year, along with the news of a mystery pathogen also causing a flu-like illness, Fuchsia City decided to temporarily close the Safari Zone to outside tourists at the beginning of February to prevent the respiratory illnesses from spreading in the animals. Closing the Safari Zone off was successful in preventing the spread of flu, and Fuchsia City only saw approximately 100 flu cases in its approximate one million residents (which included the residents, trainers, workers, doctors, and specialists that worked in the Safari Zone). Despite being closed off to the outside, the Safari Zone remained open to the locals, many of whom worked at the park. 

Despite curbing the spread of flu, the closing of the wildlife park did nothing to stop the spread of the mystery respiratory illness from spreading in some of the animals. By late January, reports of flu-like illness continued to rise. While some cases tested positive for flu, an increasing number of patients, including a few Safari Zone workers, were testing negative for all common respiratory viruses. Public health officials decided to expand testing in early February, hoping to better understand the scope of the outbreak.

First, a few of the canine species appeared to come down, along with some of the feline species. Many of the ducklings also suffered from a flu-like illness as well. Shortly afterwards many of the residents began to come down with a flu-like illness as well.
