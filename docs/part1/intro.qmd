# Welcome to the Mystery Outbreak Workshop!

Warm greetings! Traditionally, epidemics and outbreaks tend to feel like a good mystery waiting to be solved – and that will be our approach for our Viral Genomics Fundamentals Workshop! For this workshop, you will be reading through a short mystery story centered on a hypothetical outbreak scenario in the fictional city of Fuchsia City.


## Intended Audience

This module is designed for public health professionals, laboratorians, bioinformaticians, and epidemiologists who are interested in the real-world applications of viral genomics and genomic epidemiology. Whether you work in a public health lab, manage outbreak response, analyze sequencing data, or coordinate epidemiological investigations, this workshop will provide practical, scenario-based learning relevant to your work.
Workshop Format

You will explore a fictional scenario that unfolds like a detective story. As you progress, you will encounter:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Multiple choice questions to test your understanding of key concepts.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Discussion prompts designed to be open-ended, mirroring real-world ambiguity and complexity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Opportunities for creative thinking — often, there is no single “right” answer in genomic epidemiology, only more or less appropriate approaches depending on circumstances.

Points and feedback in this workshop emphasize thoughtful reasoning and creative problem-solving rather than strict accuracy. In practice, effective outbreak response is about adapting to uncertainty and making the best possible decisions with incomplete information.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Interpret genomic data to identify and characterize viral pathogens involved in an outbreak scenario.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Apply bioinformatics tools to analyze sequencing data, including genome assembly and variant identification.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Integrate epidemiological information with genomic findings to trace transmission pathways and outbreak sources.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Evaluate the effectiveness of different public health interventions based on genomic and epidemiological evidence.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Communicate findings effectively to stakeholders, considering the uncertainties and limitations inherent in outbreak investigations.


##  How to Get the Most Out of This Workshop

Engage with the material as if you are part of the outbreak investigation team. There are no trick questions; your insights, creativity, and logic are what matter most. Don’t hesitate to propose alternative solutions or discuss real-world limitations you’ve experienced in your own work. We encourage discussion and debate, as these are the hallmarks of strong outbreak response teams.

Let’s begin the investigation!
