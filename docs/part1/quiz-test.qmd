## Quiz

<form id="quiz">
    <label for="question1">What is unusual about how this illness is spreading?</label><br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer1" name="question1" value="A"> A. The illness seems to be affecting only trainers who traveled to the conference.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer2" name="question1" value="B"> B. The illness appears in people who were not in direct contact with the original sick trainers.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer3" name="question1" value="C"> C. The illness follows a seasonal flu-like pattern, peaking in January and decreasing afterwards.<br>
    <input type="radio" id="answer4" name="question1" value="D"> D. The illness is only spreading between humans, with no evidence of animal involvement.<br>

            resultText = "‚ùå Not quite. While the trainers were early cases, the illness spread to others not at the conference, which makes this explanation incomplete.";
        } else if (document.getElementById('answer3').checked) {
            resultText = "‚ùå Close, but not unusual. Many respiratory illnesses follow seasonal patterns, so this alone doesn‚Äôt explain what‚Äôs unusual.";
        } else if (document.getElementById('answer4').checked) {
            resultText = "‚ùå Actually, animal illness was reported too. That suggests interspecies transmission, which is important in zoonotic investigations.";
