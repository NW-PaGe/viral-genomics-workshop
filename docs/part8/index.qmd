# Uncovering the Source

## Testing the muubats

New swab samples were collected from the muubats, and samples were initially tested using a PCR assay developed specifically for the novel virus by the Regional Health Lab. The PCR assay targeted the S and N genes based on the consensus genome taken from one of the bat trainers. However, and to everyone’s surprise, the PCR results for the novel virus S gene and N gene came back negative, suggesting that the muubats did not currently harbor the novel virus. At first, this seemed like a dead end. If the muubats weren't carrying the virus now, how could they have been the source? But then someone remembered: All newly introduced animals had archived samples from their initial intake exams. Be that as it may, the team remained unconvinced considering new evidence, and continued to bounce hypotheses back and forth. 

Amid the discussion, someone asked, “isn’t it protocol when testing new animal species to keep a set of samples stored for potential future uses? I think we should test the first swab samples obtained from the muubats back in December”. Given the uncertainty around the origins of the outbreak, the team decided to revisit earlier samples collected during routine testing and surveillance. Among them were the archived swabs from the muubats' intake exams. If any clues had been overlooked, these samples might fill in the gaps.

With the whole team in agreement, the lab pushed forth on running a PCR test on the initial swab samples taken from the muubats. The PCR results came back positive for the S and N genes. The samples proceeded to RNA extraction and preparation for sequencing, and the samples were sequenced.

After a week, the results finally came back indicating that the novel virus was identified in the muubat samples taken from December of the previous year. The discovery raised new questions. If traces of the virus had been present months earlier, why hadn't it been detected sooner? And more importantly, what had changed since then? The Genomics Specialists Team met once again to deliberate. 

## Testing and Sequencing of Human and Animal Samples
"Now that we have a suspect pathogen," a microbiologist stood up to speak, "We should run the same PCR assay on the human and animal samples. If the results return positive for the S and N genes of the novel virus, then we should sequence them for further analyses."

Everyone was in agreement and quickly got to work. The Microbiologists ran the PCR assays on all samples, with plans to proceed to sequencing if the results were positive. If the sequencing run yielded high-quality raw reads, the Bioinformaticians would perform quality control and process the data using their in-house genome assembly pipeline.

Shortly after, the PCR assay results came back and all samples were positive for the S and N genes. The results were decisive, and the team felt the momentum shift — they were onto something.

The Microbiologists then sequenced the samples, and the sequencing run proved successful, yielding high quality raw sequencing data. Upon receiving the raw data, the Bioinformaticians performed QC and determined there were no issues of concern with the sequencing data. What was left was to generate a consensus genome for each of the sequenced cases, which also proved to be a fruitful and successful effort. The team was ready to meet once more for deliberation. 

“This is it! We got our sequencing data!” one of the Bioinformaticians exclaimed.

"Great work you guys! I can't believe how smoothly everything went, it's almost unnatural!" applauded the Molecular Epidemiologist.

The team cheered — it felt like their first real win. Excitement rippled through the room, and the momentum was palpable. They had cleared the first major hurdle. But they all knew: the hardest questions were still ahead.

## Discussion Nine:
A. What do you think this new piece of evidence could mean? 



B. With the information presented before you, what would be a valid hypothesis regarding the source of the novel virus?



C. What type of genomic analyses do you think would be helpful in testing your hypothesis?
