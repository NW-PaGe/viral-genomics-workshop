In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats.

    "text": "3.2 Standard Protocol:\nAny new animal introduced into the Safari Zone must undergo a series of examinations, testing, and training before release into the wild. This is especially critical for muubats, as bat species are known to harbor a variety of viral pathogens that can occasionally spill over into humans or other animals. To reduce this risk, all candidate species are tested for known bacterial and viral agents capable of causing illness.\nOne of the most transformative technologies in pathogen detection is whole genome sequencing (WGS). Unlike traditional diagnostic tests that are designed to detect specific pathogens, WGS sequences the complete genetic material present in a sample and can identify a wide variety of microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and others, in a single analysis. This broad scope is what makes WGS such a powerful tool for clinical testing and routine surveillance.\nFrom an epidemiological standpoint, WGS offers far greater resolution than conventional tests. Traditional methods may only reveal that two cases are infected with the same species or virus, but WGS allows investigators to examine genetic subtypes, genotypes, or even specific mutations. This is particularly useful for identifying whether two individuals are infected by the same strain or by genetically distinct lineages, which may indicate that the cases are not linked. In outbreak investigations, WGS can therefore be used to rule out cases that are not epidemiologically connected. Conversely, sequences that are genetically similar, especially when linked across space and time, may suggest a common source or chain of transmission.\nHowever, WGS still depends on the quality of the underlying databases used for taxonomic identification. If a pathogen is completely novel, or if only limited genomic data exist for that organism, the system may fail to identify it. In addition, low-abundance pathogens or technical biases in sequencing can lead to false negatives. These limitations are important when interpreting negative results, particularly in surveillance contexts where early detection is crucial.",

    "text": "3.3 Testing the muubats:\nUpon arrival, each of the four muubats underwent a full physical examination and sample collection. Blood and swab samples were collected from each bat. Blood samples were cultured for bacterial growth over 48 to 72 hours, yielding no viable colonies. Remaining samples were archived for potential future use.\nSwab samples, collected from oral and cloacal sites, were analyzed using a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel, which is a specific application of WGS. Unlike shotgun metagenomics, which is used to analyze complex samples containing many organisms, such as wastewater or stool, a pathogen-agnostic panel is typically used for clinical or single-host samples where the goal is to sequence all microbial nucleic acids in the specimen without targeting a particular species. In this case, the panel was used to detect any known microbial genomes present in the bat swabs by comparing the sequencing output to reference databases.\nWhile this approach is broad in scope, it is limited to organisms that already have validated reference sequences. If a novel virus is present in the sample but not represented in the database, the test may return a negative result, even if the pathogen is there.\nFollowing nucleic acid extraction, the samples were prepped for sequencing, with a turnaround time of approximately ten days. During this time, the muubats remained in isolation and interacted only with their trainers. Swab extracts were also archived at minus 80 degrees Celsius in accordance with facility protocol.\nWhen the sequencing results returned, they showed no evidence of any known pathogens associated with illness. With culture and sequencing data both suggesting the muubats were healthy, they were relocated to a designated training facility within the Safari Zone to begin acclimatization.",

Testing focused on symptomatic individuals, and sequencing efforts were based on whatever diagnostic samples were still usable. However, if you were planning a sampling strategy from the beginning, without those limitations, what would an ideal sampling scheme look like?\nDescribe the sampling approach you think would be most effective for understanding and controlling this outbreak. What do you want to capture, and how does your sampling strategy help you do that?\nYou might consider:\n- Sequencing all available cases for a comprehensive view,\n- Selecting a random or representative subset of samples for statistical inference,\n- Focusing on specific populations, such as symptomatic individuals, geographic clusters, or particular animal species,\n- Or combining more than one of these strategies.\nExplain your reasoning.

    "text": "8.1 Regional Lab Capacity\nThe Regional Health Lab was equipped to perform a range of sequencing strategies. These included:\n- Short-read sequencing, which offers high accuracy for detecting single nucleotide variants.\n- Long-read sequencing, which is used for assembling entire genomes and identifying larger structural changes.\n- Shotgun metagenomics, which sequences all the genetic material in a sample and is especially useful when the pathogen is unknown or difficult to culture.\nIn addition to sequencing platforms, the lab maintained a suite of bioinformatics pipelines designed to transform raw data into usable insights. These pipelines typically include:\n- Quality control, to filter out poor-quality reads and contaminants.\n    - Read alignment or de novo assembly, to reconstruct genomes by either mapping reads to a known reference or assembling them from scratch.\n    - Taxonomic classification, which uses reference databases to identify the organism or organisms present.\n    - Mutation detection and annotation, which catalogs genetic differences and assesses their potential biological or epidemiological significance.\nThese outputs are then used by Molecular Epidemiologists to investigate whether certain sequences are closely related, how the virus may have spread between hosts, and whether transmission clusters or spillover events can be inferred from the genetic data. While they typically rely on genome assemblies or other processed sequencing outputs prepared by Bioinformaticians, Molecular Epidemiologists are also capable of performing genomic analyses themselves. These may include generating pairwise distance matrices, constructing phylogenetic trees, or conducting other comparative analyses that help link genetic variation to patterns of transmission and exposure.\nThe team coordinated with doctors and animal trainers to have swab samples shipped from across Fuchsia City and the Safari Zone. Samples included those from symptomatic humans, trainers, Safari Zone workers, and affected animals such as felines, canines, ducklings, and the two bat trainers.\nTable showing the number of swab samples collected and shipped to the Regional Health Lab.\nMost of the samples came from symptomatic individuals and visibly ill animals, though a few were collected from individuals who had been exposed but were not yet showing symptoms. Samples collected in February were reviewed for quality, and only those with sufficient material were retained for sequencing. The majority of high-quality samples came from January and early February, when active archiving had begun.\nThis stage of the investigation marks a critical shift in the outbreak response. Earlier phases focused on observing symptoms, collecting samples, and forming initial hypotheses. With the involvement of the Regional Health Lab, the investigation now moves into testing, sequencing, bioinformatics, and molecular epidemiology. These steps are foundational to understanding the genetic characteristics of the pathogen and informing a targeted public health response.",

Any signs of illness, behavioral changes, or unusual mortality events were carefully recorded.\nMeanwhile, Local Health Epidemiologists conducted interviews with symptomatic individuals, close contacts, and facility staff. They used their human case forms to track onset dates, travel histories, occupational roles, and protective behaviors. Special attention was given to individuals who worked across multiple zones or species, or who had recent contact with sick trainers or animals.\nEach team collected data methodically, ensuring consistency in how information was recorded. As the fieldwork progressed, they began to notice recurring patterns: clusters of illness tied to specific enclosures, overlapping work schedules, or repeated contact with a small set of animal species. These early findings would soon feed back into the hypothesis generation process and guide the genomic and epidemiologic analyses still underway.\nWith dozens of interviews completed and sample metadata flowing into the shared outbreak database, the teams prepared to regroup with the Genomics Specialists to share their findings. While the sequencing and bioinformatics work continued in parallel, the insights gathered in the field would soon provide critical context for interpreting the genomic data. The results of the field investigation wouldn’t be fully realized until later, when they could be integrated with the Molecular Epidemiologists’ analysis of the viral genomes.\nFor now, attention shifted to the lab, where scientists began working to identify the pathogen hidden within the samples collected from human cases.",

The PCR assay targeted the S and N genes based on the consensus genome taken from one of the bat trainers. However, and to everyone’s surprise, the PCR results for the novel virus S gene and N gene came back negative, suggesting that the muubats did not currently harbor the novel virus. At first, this seemed like a dead end. If the muubats weren’t carrying the virus now, how could they have been the source? But then someone remembered: All newly introduced animals had archived samples from their initial intake exams. Be that as it may, the team remained unconvinced considering new evidence, and continued to bounce hypotheses back and forth.\nAmid the discussion, someone asked, “isn’t it protocol when testing new animal species to keep a set of samples stored for potential future uses? I think we should test the first swab samples obtained from the muubats back in December”. Given the uncertainty around the origins of the outbreak, the team decided to revisit earlier samples collected during routine testing and surveillance. Among them were the archived swabs from the muubats’ intake exams. If any clues had been overlooked, these samples might fill in the gaps.\nWith the whole team in agreement, the lab pushed forth on running a PCR test on the initial swab samples taken from the muubats. The PCR results came back positive for the S and N genes. The samples proceeded to RNA extraction and preparation for sequencing, and the samples were sequenced.\nAfter a week, the results finally came back indicating that the novel virus was identified in the muubat samples taken from December of the previous year. The discovery raised new questions. If the virus was present in the muubats months earlier, why was it not detected or causing illness at the time? What may have changed between the original exposure and the emergence of symptomatic cases in humans and animals? The Genomics Specialists Team met once again to deliberate.",

These scores, often referred to as Phred scores, indicate the probability that a particular base call is incorrect. A higher score means higher confidence. Reads with many low-quality bases (i.e.typically at the ends) are prone to errors and can introduce false variants during genome assembly. To mitigate this, the team removed or trimmed low-quality bases from the reads to retain only high-confidence data.\nNext, the Microbiologists checked for and trimmed adapter sequences, short artificial DNA fragments that are added during the library preparation process so the sequencer can recognize and read the sample. If these adapters aren’t trimmed out, they can contaminate the data and interfere with downstream analyses, especially alignment and assembly. Specialized tools scan for known adapter sequences and remove them from the raw reads.\nThey also looked for overrepresented sequences and duplicate reads, which can suggest library preparation artifacts, contamination, or biased amplification. These patterns can distort coverage or make a dataset appear more robust than it actually is. Removing redundancy helps ensure that the reads truly reflect the diversity of genetic material in the original sample.\nAnother important step involved assessing GC content, the proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the sequences. Abnormal GC content compared to what’s expected for the target organism can suggest contamination or poor amplification. GC bonds typically require more heat to break than AT bonds because they contain more hydrogen bonds than AT, which can further complicate wet lab methods. The Bioinformaticians also screened for reads that aligned to common laboratory contaminants or host genomes, excluding these from the dataset to focus on relevant microbial content.\nAfter passing all of these checks, the data was considered high quality. With confidence in their sequencing reads, the team proceeded to genome assembly — now working from a dataset that was clean, trimmed, and ready to be pieced together.\nSummary of Bioinformatics Pre-Genome Assembly QC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQC Step\nWhy It Matters\nHow It’s Typically Done (Tool-Agnostic Description)\n\n\n\n\nRead Quality Scoring\nIdentifies bases with high error probabilities that can cause false variants.\nBase-level quality scores are used to trim or filter out low-confidence regions.\n\n\nAdapter Trimming\nRemoves artificial sequences that interfere with alignment or assembly.\nReads are scanned for known adapter patterns and trimmed accordingly.\n\n\nOverrepresented Sequence Check\nDetects artifacts or biased amplification that distort microbial composition.\nRepeated sequences are flagged as disproportionately frequent and optionally removed.\n\n\nDuplicate Read Removal\nReduces artificial inflation of coverage caused by PCR duplicates.\nIdentical or highly similar reads are collapsed into single representative instances.\n\n\nGC Content Assessment\nFlags contamination or poor amplification based on sequence composition.\nGC content is compared to expected profiles for the target organism.\n\n\nContaminant Screening\nEnsures non-target DNA (e.g., human or lab contaminants) is excluded.\nReads are mapped against reference genomes to filter out known contaminant sequences.\n\n\n\n“This is it!

There are many different specialized software that can generate a sequence alignment as well as genome browsers that can provide an overview of an alignment. Using an in-house specialized alignment software, the team aligned the viral sequences from infected humans, animals, and archived samples to look for similarities, differences, and possible mutations.\n“Think of this like assembling pages of a shredded document”, one of the Bioinformaticians explained. “Each sequence is a tiny fragment of a much larger picture. By aligning them properly, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to see how these sequences are related.”\nAligning sequences wasn’t just about assembling data; it was about uncovering a hidden evolutionary history.

    "text": "17.2 What Can We Learn from an Alignment?\nAs the team examined the alignment results, they noted key patterns. For instance, they looked for conserved regions, certain parts of the genome that were nearly identical across all samples, which can indicate genomic stablity. These regions might be essential for the virus’ survival and any heritable change like a mutation could have a devastating effect if it occurred in these regions. The team also looked for mutations. Mutations present in a sample could often be referred to as a SNP - single nucleotide polymorphism. Some sequences can contain SNPs, which are tiny genetic changes that could indicate viral evolution or adaptation to different hosts. The team also looked for insertions and deletions, often referred to as “indels” in the alignments. Indels are small insertions or missing bases which could suggest structural changes in the virus over time. Most importantly, the team looked for gaps in the alignment. Gaps could be missing data or low-quality sequencing reads that have appeared as gaps. These typically require further investigation to determine if gaps are true deletions or just artifacts from sequencing errors.\n“Look at this!” one of the Molecular Epidemiologists pointed to the screen. “These human samples from February are similar to the muubat sequences, but with a few mutations.” After a moment of a silence, another Molecular Epidemiology asked “I wonder what the collection dates are for these sequences. Could the later sequences have more mutations than the earlier sequences?” It wouldn’t be such a farfetch’d thought. “If so, it would mean that the sequences are slowly becoming more divergent over time, especially if there’s a specific region where we see a bunch of mutations occurring” explained another Molecular Epidemiologist.",

They looked to see if the earlier samples, particularly those from the Bat Trainers and even Safari Zone Workers shared high sequence similarity or a high degree of resemblance with the muubat samples from December. If the virus were to continue spreading, it’s likely that mutations will begin to accumulate in the later samples suggesting human-to-human transmission had allowed the virus to evolve further.\n“It would be expected that the sequences with more mutations might be the later samples,” said one of the Bioinformaticians. “Once a virus moves into a new host, it undergoes small changes. But the key question is, is this a spillover event? Are there multiple spillover events, or did this virus jump from animals to humans just once and then spread onwards from there?”\nThat question led them back to the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), where they could visually inspect how each genome differed. The team noticed another critical detail: it appeared that there were some mutations concentrated in a specific region. What protein that gene region could code for could have implications for viral infectivity. Additionally, they noticed that some sequences shared a very high degree of similarity with the muubat samples.\n“Are you all seeing this?” One of the Molecular Epidemiologists asked, pointing to the mutations and the similar sequences. “It’s possible to infer a single spillover event followed by onward transmission in humans,” one of the Zoonotic Epidemiologists noted.\n“We should generate a pairwise distance matrix and a phylogenetic tree to see if this confirms what we are seeing in the alignment.”",

    "text": "19.1 Pairwise Distance Matrices\nA pairwise distance matrix is a table that quantifies the genetic differences between sequences by counting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPS are individual base differences at specific nucleotide posititions in the genome. It helps to determine how closely related two samples are and whether genetic clustering aligns with known epidemiological links.\nEach cell in the matrix represents the number of SNP differences between a pair of genome sequences. The smaller the number, the more similar the sequences are. A value of 0 means the sequences are identical.\nComputing pairwise distance matrices is a relatively straightfoward process with several steps. First the sequence are aligned (or arranged to where the sequences line up together). In this case, each viral genome would be aligned to the reference genome to detect differences in nucleotide positions. Next, one would count the SNP differences. Each genome is compared and the number of nucleotide differences are counted. This produces a matrix where row = column (since sequence A vs B is the same as B vs A). Lastly, heatmaps can be generated from the matrices to give a visual representation using a color scheme.\nExample illustrating a Pairwise Distance Matrix This pairwise distance compares the number of mutation differences between two sequences. For example, the number of mutation difference, also known as the genetic distance, between Sequence A and the reference sequence is 0, meaning that the sequences are identical and possess no differences in mutations. However, Sequence D has a genetic distance of 2 when compared to the reference sequence, meaning that there are 2 mutations not shared between the two sequences. As such, Sequence A is more closely related to the reference than Sequence D. In terms of tracing how the virus spreads or its transmission, it is likely that the reference and Sequence A belong to the same transmission chain than that of the reference and Sequence D.\nExample illustrating a heatmap of a pairwise distance matrix\n“I see now, thank you so much!

    "text": "19.2 Phylogenetic Trees\nA phylogenetic tree is a hierarchical clustering or branching diagram that represents the evolutionary relationships between sequences based on genetic similarity. In this outbreak investigation, the tree helps determine how closely related viral genomes are across different individuals and species. Think of it as a family tree where we can trace the ancestry of a virus.\nEach tip (or leaf) on the tree represents a sample’s genome sequence of the virus. The branches connecting them indicate evolutionary relationships, or the sharing of a common ancestor, and branch length represent the amount of genetic difference between sequences.\nWhen interpreting trees, there’s so much to consider! Yet, let’s keep it simple and expand on the concept of a “family tree” with sequences being “closely related”. Samples that are closer together along the x-axis being more genetically similar and genetically related to each other. Shorter branch lengths indicate fewer genetic differences between sequences, meaning that there’s less mutations between the sequences and they share a more recent common ancestor. However, longer branches means an accumulation of more mutations. As such, this would mean that the sequences are less closely related or are distantly related. Identical sequences would occur along the same x-axis but would be stacked vertically on the y-axis for visibility.\nExample illustrating phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment Imagine this tree to represent viral sequences of pathogen X. This phylogenetic tree was constructed using a character-based method called Maximum Likelihood. Rather than simply counting differences between sequences, this approach infers the tree that best explains the observed pattern of mutations across the entire alignment. The tree is rooted using the reference genome (Ref). Rooting trees can help give directionality to the topology of the tree. The Ref and SeqA are genetically identical, and both appear stacked on the same branch, indicating no differences between them.\nFrom that basal position, SeqE is the first to branch off and forms an outgroup relative to Seqs B through D. This suggests that SeqE diverged earlier in the outbreak or represents a more distinct lineage. Further up the tree, SeqD branches from an internal node that also gives rise to Seqs B and C. Within that cluster, SeqB remains on the internal node, while SeqC is on a longer branch, indicating it has acquired additional mutations. It appears that SeqB and SeqC are genetically similar, with SeqC possessing more mutations that SeqB does not share. When we look at the sequence alignment above and the heatmap of the pairwise distance matrix, we see that SeqC possess one extra mutation than SeqB. Additional epidemiologic information could be helpful to determine if these two cases are epidemiologically related in space and time, with SeqC indicating possible onward transmission.\nIn this tree, the horizontal axis represents divergence, or the degree of evolutionary difference from the root. Divergence reflects the expected amount of change across the genome based on a model of nucleotide substitution. While it generally correlates with mutation accumulation, it’s not a direct count of observed differences. Instead, it accounts for factors like multiple changes at the same site or underlying mutation probabilities. Because of this, divergence values help us compare relative relationships, but should not be interpreted as exact mutation counts.\nIt’s important to keep in mind caveats and limitations when interpreting phylogenetic trees. For example, while this tree reflects the sequencing data and the underlying mutations observed in the sequence, its structure can offer insights into possible transmission relationships, particularly if sequences that are genetically similar were also sampled close together in time and space. However, because the Maximum Likelihood approach does not reconstruct mutation order or directionality, it cannot by itself establish who infected whom or infer precise chains of transmission without incorporating additional epidemiological data.\nExample illustrating a phylogenetic tree \n“I see now” said the Local Health Jursidiction Epidemiologist. “Thank you so much for explaining! I imagine the process to generate the trees requires some form of computation?”\n“Absolutely!” cheered the Molecular Epidemiologist. I’m happy to explain that as well.\n\n19.2.1 Generating Phylogenetic Trees\nOnce genome sequences are aligned and mutations are identified, the next step is to construct a phylogenetic tree, a visual representation of their evolutionary relationships.\nPhylogenetic trees can be constructed using two broad approaches: distance-based and character-based methods, each with its own strengths and limitations depending on the data and goals of the analysis.\n    - Distance-based methods (such as Neighbor-Joining or UPGMA) calculate a matrix of pairwise genetic distances, typically using the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating each sequence pair. A clustering algorithm then builds a tree that groups sequences with the smallest genetic distances. These methods are fast and computationally efficient, but they simplify sequence relationships and don’t account for site-specific mutation patterns.\n    - Character-based methods (such as Maximum Parsimony or Maximum Likelihood) work directly from the multiple sequence alignment. These methods examine each nucleotide position across all sequences to infer the tree that best explains the observed mutations. They are typically more accurate, as they consider evolutionary models and the likelihood of different mutation events, but are also more computationally intensive.\nIn general, the process begins by generating a multiple sequence alignment, where all sequences are compared nucleotide by nucleotide to identify mutations. For distance-based methods, a distance matrix is derived from this alignment and used to construct the tree. For character-based methods, the alignment itself is analyzed directly using statistical models of sequence evolution.\nChoosing between these methods depends on several factors:\n    - Speed vs. accuracy: Distance-based trees are faster, while character-based methods are more accurate for closely related sequences.\n    - Data quality and length: Character-based approaches perform better with full genomes and datasets that include homoplasy or recurrent mutations.\n    - Evolutionary modeling: Character-based trees incorporate substitution models (like GTR) to estimate mutation rates and account for multiple changes at the same site.\n    - Time-resolved inference: Character-based methods integrate easily with molecular clocks, allowing estimates of divergence timing and outbreak dynamics.\nRegardless of the method, the final tree depicts the relationship between sequences. A distanced-based tree might reflect degree of genetic similarity, whereas a character-based tree might reflect evolutionary relationship between the sequences and evolutionary history. In this analysis, we are particularly interested in whether sequences from the muubats and infected trainers cluster closely together, which would support a zoonotic spillover event from animals to humans. Alternatively, if human sequences form a separate, branching cluster that diverges over time, it may indicate ongoing human-to-human transmission following the initial spillover.",

The line list shows the sample IDs of the sequenced cases in the outbreak. The second column shows the collection date of the samples collected from the case in year-month-day format. The third column shows the exposure notes collected from the case interviews conducted during the outbreak investigation. Unfortunately some of the cases, such as the residents, could not be reached. Some information remains incomplete for the workers as some workers tend to work in different areas, and are involved in different responsibilities when it comes to taking care of the animals and the park.\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic Tree of Flu-Like Illness Outbreak, Fuchsia City, Safari Zone\n\n\nOpen tree in new tab for full view\nPhylogenetic Tree of Outbreak. This phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships between sequences from the outbreak. The tips on the tree represent individual genome sequences of the virus, which are color-coded by species in relation to the park. The x-axis represents divergence (also sometimes referred to as genetic distance, or the number of mutations from the reference genome). To give an example, the reference genome is 5000 bases long, so a divergence of 0.0006 would mean 3 mutations difference. (5000 * 0.0006).\nNote that identical sequences like muubat_02, muubat_03, and muubat_04 lie on the same x-axis and are stacked vertically. Comparing the muubat sequences with the sequences of the residents, the branch length of the resident is much longer indicating that the viruses that infected the muubats are less closely related to the residents.\n\n\n\nExposure Map of Animals, Trainers, and Workers\n\n\nExposure Map. The exposure map uses information from the case interview to piece together how animals, trainers, and workers might be linked together in the outbreak. Lines indicate that the case was either exposed to or had an interaction with the other cases or animals.\n\n\n\nHeatmap of SNP Distances of Sequences in Outbreak\n\n\nHeatmap. The heatmap shows the pairwise distance between two sequences. The pairwise distance is given by the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single base difference between two sequences. The range of SNP differences for the sequenced cases in the outbreak is 0 to 9. A SNP distnace of 0 (darkest color) means that two sequences are identical, while a higher SNP count (lighter color) indicates greater genetic divergence. Comparing this heatmap with the phylogenetic tree helps confirm whether clusters of closely related sequences correspond to expected epidemiological links. Sequences that are darker in color indicate fewer SNP differences between the two sequences, whereas lighter color indicates more SNP differences between the two cases.",

What we have accomplished during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects this.\nThe sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed surveillance and epidemiologic analyses. This learning experience has ushered us in a new direction of infectious disease intelligence and surveillance, where pathogen genomes can be used for more insightful analyses like phylodynamics, transmission dynamics, variant detection, estimating disease severity, among other things. From this experience, there’s ample opportunity and room to expand sequencing and genomics to other pathogens of notifiable conditions.\nIn the future, once we are more established in this field, we can begin to build a global warning system for future pandemics of emerging pathogens. In a sense, we do a lot of this kind of work right now with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, all that we do now and the work that we invest in will serve as a model for the ways in which we can monitor, prevent, and control infectious diseases and it’s looking to be a very optimistic future direction.\nThis story is meant to help build capacity in Pathogen Genomics, whether you are a laboratorian, epidemiologist, bioinformatician, infectious disease specialist, and the like.
