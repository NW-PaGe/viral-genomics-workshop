The newest attraction of fruits bats includes the muubat, one of the friendliest and meek bat species to interact with. In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats. To garner attention to the newest attraction, Fuchsia City advertised that the muubats should be fully integrated into the Safari Zone by the summertime.",

Unfortunately, the risks with muubats, like all bat species, is that they tend to harbor many different viral diseases that cause nasty infections in humans. It is protocol when introducing new bat species, as well as many other animal species, to test the animal for any known diseases, both bacterial and viral, that could cause spillover into humans and the other animals. Oftentimes the presence of a microorganism in an animal is confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, which detects the presence of different microbes that can cause disease. As the advent of whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and its utility is very much new to the city’s surveillance methods, work is still ongoing to be able to detect novel pathogens which have not been previously encountered before.",

Blood samples and swab samples are taken per individual bat, and are subjected to bacterial culture, and a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel. Culture from blood samples generally takes 48 to 72 hours, and according to the results, none of the blood samples from any of the four bats produced viable colonies. Any leftover blood samples were stored for potential future uses. For the swab samples, genetic material is extracted from the swabs, and then prepped for sequencing. The turn-around time for sequencing to bioinformatics takes about a week and a half. The muubats are kept in an isolated environment interacting only with the trainers during their time in quarantine. It is protocol to obtain enough swab samples for which the extracts could be stored, so both additional and leftover extracts were stored in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer for potential future uses. After a week and a half, the taxonomic identification results from the pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel came back negative, indicating that none of the bats carried any known pathogens that caused infections in humans. With testing and sequencing indicating that the muubats appeared to be clear and healthy, the fruit bats were then relocated to another facility area to begin training.",

    "text": "14.1 What is Sequencing Alignment and Why Does it Matter?\nOne of the most powerful tools in genomics is a sequence alignment, a process that allows scientists to compare genomic sequences and look for patterns that could provide clues about the outbreak. There are many different specialized software that can generate a sequence alignment as well as genome browsers that can provide an overview of an alignment. Using an in-house specialized alignment sofrware, the team aligned the viral sequences from infected humans, animals, and archived samples to look for similarities, differences, and possible mutations.\n“Think of this like assembling pages of a shredded document”, one of the Bioinformaticians explained. “Each sequence is a tiny fragment of a much larger picture. By aligning them properly, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to see how these sequences are related.”\nAligning sequences wasn’t just about assembling data; it was about uncovering a hidden evolutionary history. Every mutation, every missing base, every small change can tell a story about how the virus was spreading an evolving.",

    "text": "14.2 What Can We Learn from an Alignment?\nAs the team examined the alignment results, they noted key patterns. For instance, they looked for conserved regions, certain parts of the genome that were nearly identical across all samples, which can indicate genomic stablity. These regions might be essential for the virus’ survival and any heritable change like a mutation could have a devastating effect if it occurred in these regions. The team also looked for mutations. Mutations present in a sample could often be referred to as a SNP - single nucleotide polymorphism. Some sequences can contain SNPs, which are tiny genetic changes that could indicate viral evolution or adaptation to different hosts. The team also looked for insertions and deletions, often referred to as “indels” in the alignments. Indels are small insertions ore missing bases which could suggest structural changes in the virus over time. Most importantly, the team looked for gaps in the alignment. Gaps could be missing data or low-quality sequencing reads that have appeared as gaps. These typically require further investigation to determine if gaps are true deletions or just artifacts from sequencing errors.\n“Look at this!” one of the Molecular Epidemiologists pointed to the screen. “These human samples from February are clustering really close to the muubat sequences.” After a moment of a silence, another Molecular Epidemiology asked “I wonder what the collection dates are for these sequences. Could the later sequences have more mutations than the earlier sequences?” It wouldn’t be such a farfetch’d thought. “If so, it would mean that the sequences are slowly becoming more divergent over time, especially if there’s a specific region where we see a bunch of mutations occurring” explained another Molecular Epidemiologist.",

They looked to see if the earlier samples, particularly those from the Bat Trainers and even Safari Zone Workers shared high sequence similarity or a high degree of resemblance with the muubat samples from December. If the virus were to continue spreading, it’s likely that mutations will begin to accumulate in the later samples suggesting human-to-human transmission had allowed the virus to evolve further.\n“It would be expected that the sequences with more mutations might be the later samples,” said one of the Bioinformaticians. “Once a virus moves into a new host, it undergoes small changes. But the key question is, is this a spillover event? Are there multiple spillover events, or did this virus jump from animals to humans just once and then spread onwards from there?”\nThat question led them back to the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), where they could visually inspect how each genome differed. The team noticed another critical detail: it appeared that there were some mutations concentrated in a specific region. What protein that gene region could code for could have implications for viral infectivity. Additionally, they noticed that some sequences shared a very high degree of similarity with the muubat samples.\n“Are you all seeing this?” One of the Molecular Epidemiologists asked, pointing to the mutations and the similar sequences. “It’s possible to infer a single spillover event followed by onward transmission in humans,” one of the Zoonotic Epidemiologists noted.\n“We should generate a pairwise distance matrix and a phylogenetic tree to see if this confirms what we are seeing in the alignment.”",

    "text": "Pathogen Genomics is a new and revolutionary field in Public Health and it represents a new direction of infectious disease intelligence and surveillance. What we have accomplished during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects this.\nThe sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed surveillance and epidemiologic analyses. This learning experience has ushered us in a new direction of infectious disease intelligence and surveillance, where pathogen genomes can be used for more insightful analyses like phylodynamics, transmission dynamics, variant detection, estimating disease severity, among other things. From this experience, there’s ample opportunity and room to expand sequencing and genomics to other pathogens of notifiable conditions.\nIn the future, once we are more established in this field, we can begin to build a global warning system for future pandemics of emerging pathogens. In a sense, we do a lot of this kind of work right now with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, all that we do now and the work that we invest in will serve as a model for the ways in which we can monitor, prevent, and control infectious diseases and it’s looking to be a very optimistic future direction.\nThis story is meant to help build capacity in Pathogen Genomics, whether you are a laboratorian, epidemiologist, bioinformatician, infectious disease specialist, and the like. Furthermore, this mystery outbreak story is an ode to all of the public health professionals, researchers, scientists, and healthcare workers that worked tirelessly on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the newcomers who are interested in this area. We seek to revolutionalize our surveillance systems and infrastructure, and you too, can be a part of this undertaking.\n\nSteph M Lunn\n\nHave questions?
