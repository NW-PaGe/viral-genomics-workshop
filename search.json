    "text": "2.1 Intended Audience\nThis module is designed for public health professionals, laboratorians, bioinformaticians, and epidemiologists who are interested in the real-world applications of viral genomics and genomic epidemiology. Whether you work in a public health lab, manage outbreak response, analyze sequencing data, or coordinate epidemiological investigations, this workshop will provide practical, scenario-based learning relevant to your work. Workshop Format\nYou will explore a fictional scenario that unfolds like a detective story. As you progress, you will encounter:\n- Multiple choice questions to test your understanding of key concepts.\n- Discussion prompts designed to be open-ended, mirroring real-world ambiguity and complexity.\n- Opportunities for creative thinking — often, there is no single “right” answer in genomic epidemiology, only more or less appropriate approaches depending on circumstances.\nPoints and feedback in this workshop emphasize thoughtful reasoning and creative problem-solving rather than strict accuracy. In practice, effective outbreak response is about adapting to uncertainty and making the best possible decisions with incomplete information.",

In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats.

Unfortunately, the risks with muubats, like all bat species, is that they tend to harbor many different viral diseases that cause nasty infections in humans. It is protocol when introducing new bat species, as well as many other animal species, to test the animal for any known diseases, both bacterial and viral, that could cause spillover into humans and the other animals. Oftentimes the presence of a microorganism in an animal is confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, which detects the presence of different microbes that can cause disease. Since the advent of whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and its utility is very much new to the city’s surveillance methods, work is still ongoing to be able to detect novel pathogens. Next-generation sequencing could miss a pathogen for a variety of reasons, including database limitations or not having any data for the pathogen; pathogens at low abundance could be missed; and some sequencing protocols may only be designed to detect a certain pathogen.",

Blood samples and swab samples are taken per individual bat, and are subjected to bacterial culture, and a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel. Culture from blood samples generally takes 48 to 72 hours, and according to the results, none of the blood samples from any of the four bats produced viable colonies. Any leftover blood samples were stored for potential future uses. For the swab samples, genetic material is extracted from the swabs, and then prepped for sequencing. The turn-around time for sequencing to bioinformatics takes about a week and a half. The muubats are kept in an isolated environment interacting only with the trainers during their time in quarantine. It is protocol to obtain enough swab samples for which the extracts could be stored, so both additional and leftover extracts were stored in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer for potential future uses. After a week and a half, the taxonomic identification results from the pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel came back negative, indicating that none of the bats carried any known pathogens that caused infections in humans. With testing and sequencing indicating that the muubats appeared to be clear and healthy, the fruit bats were then relocated to another facility area to begin training.",

The PCR assay targeted the S and N genes based on the consensus genome taken from one of the bat trainers. However, and to everyone’s surprise, the PCR results for the novel virus S gene and N gene came back negative, suggesting that the muubats did not currently harbor the novel virus. At first, this seemed like a dead end. If the muubats weren’t carrying the virus now, how could they have been the source? But then someone remembered: All newly introduced animals had archived samples from their initial intake exams. Be that as it may, the team remained unconvinced considering new evidence, and continued to bounce hypotheses back and forth.\nAmid the discussion, someone asked, “isn’t it protocol when testing new animal species to keep a set of samples stored for potential future uses? I think we should test the first swab samples obtained from the muubats back in December”. Given the uncertainty around the origins of the outbreak, the team decided to revisit earlier samples collected during routine testing and surveillance. Among them were the archived swabs from the muubats’ intake exams. If any clues had been overlooked, these samples might fill in the gaps.\nWith the whole team in agreement, the lab pushed forth on running a PCR test on the initial swab samples taken from the muubats. The PCR results came back positive for the S and N genes. The samples proceeded to RNA extraction and preparation for sequencing, and the samples were sequenced.\nAfter a week, the results finally came back indicating that the novel virus was identified in the muubat samples taken from December of the previous year. The discovery raised new questions. If traces of the virus had been present months earlier, why hadn’t it been detected sooner? And more importantly, what had changed since then?

The Microbiologists ran the PCR assays on all samples, with plans to proceed to sequencing if the results were positive. If the sequencing run yielded high-quality raw reads, the Bioinformaticians would perform quality control and process the data using their in-house genome assembly pipeline.\nShortly after, the PCR assay results came back and all samples were positive for the S and N genes. The results were decisive, and the team felt the momentum shift — they were onto something.\nThe Microbiologists then sequenced the samples, and the sequencing run proved successful, yielding high quality raw sequencing data. Upon receiving the raw data, the Bioinformaticians performed QC and determined there were no issues of concern with the sequencing data. What was left was to generate a consensus genome for each of the sequenced cases, which also proved to be a fruitful and successful effort. The team was ready to meet once more for deliberation.\n“This is it! We got our sequencing data!” one of the Bioinformaticians exclaimed.\n“Great work you guys! I can’t believe how smoothly everything went, it’s almost unnatural!” applauded the Molecular Epidemiologist.\nThe team cheered — it felt like their first real win.

For example sequence A has no mutations when compared to the reference, however sequence B has one mutation at base position 16 that changes a thymine to a cytosine.\nOne of the most powerful tools in genomics is a sequence alignment, a process that allows scientists to compare genomic sequences and look for patterns that could provide clues about the outbreak. There are many different specialized software that can generate a sequence alignment as well as genome browsers that can provide an overview of an alignment. Using an in-house specialized alignment software, the team aligned the viral sequences from infected humans, animals, and archived samples to look for similarities, differences, and possible mutations.\n“Think of this like assembling pages of a shredded document”, one of the Bioinformaticians explained. “Each sequence is a tiny fragment of a much larger picture. By aligning them properly, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to see how these sequences are related.”\nAligning sequences wasn’t just about assembling data; it was about uncovering a hidden evolutionary history.

    "text": "15.2 What Can We Learn from an Alignment?\nAs the team examined the alignment results, they noted key patterns. For instance, they looked for conserved regions, certain parts of the genome that were nearly identical across all samples, which can indicate genomic stablity. These regions might be essential for the virus’ survival and any heritable change like a mutation could have a devastating effect if it occurred in these regions. The team also looked for mutations. Mutations present in a sample could often be referred to as a SNP - single nucleotide polymorphism. Some sequences can contain SNPs, which are tiny genetic changes that could indicate viral evolution or adaptation to different hosts. The team also looked for insertions and deletions, often referred to as “indels” in the alignments. Indels are small insertions or missing bases which could suggest structural changes in the virus over time. Most importantly, the team looked for gaps in the alignment. Gaps could be missing data or low-quality sequencing reads that have appeared as gaps. These typically require further investigation to determine if gaps are true deletions or just artifacts from sequencing errors.\n“Look at this!” one of the Molecular Epidemiologists pointed to the screen. “These human samples from February are similar to the muubat sequences, but with a few mutations.” After a moment of a silence, another Molecular Epidemiology asked “I wonder what the collection dates are for these sequences. Could the later sequences have more mutations than the earlier sequences?” It wouldn’t be such a farfetch’d thought. “If so, it would mean that the sequences are slowly becoming more divergent over time, especially if there’s a specific region where we see a bunch of mutations occurring” explained another Molecular Epidemiologist.",

If the virus were to continue spreading, it’s likely that mutations will begin to accumulate in the later samples suggesting human-to-human transmission had allowed the virus to evolve further.\n“It would be expected that the sequences with more mutations might be the later samples,” said one of the Bioinformaticians. “Once a virus moves into a new host, it undergoes small changes. But the key question is, is this a spillover event? Are there multiple spillover events, or did this virus jump from animals to humans just once and then spread onwards from there?”\nThat question led them back to the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), where they could visually inspect how each genome differed. The team noticed another critical detail: it appeared that there were some mutations concentrated in a specific region. What protein that gene region could code for could have implications for viral infectivity. Additionally, they noticed that some sequences shared a very high degree of similarity with the muubat samples.\n“Are you all seeing this?” One of the Molecular Epidemiologists asked, pointing to the mutations and the similar sequences. “It’s possible to infer a single spillover event followed by onward transmission in humans,” one of the Zoonotic Epidemiologists noted.\n“We should generate a pairwise distance matrix and a phylogenetic tree to see if this confirms what we are seeing in the alignment.”",

Any low-quality sequences, ambiguous regions, or problematic reads had to be identified and removed. “It’s good that we are doing QC on the alignment” one of the Bioinformatician mentioned. “If the alignment isn’t clean, the entire phylogenetic tree could be misleading”.\nAs they carefully reviewed the alignment, they specifically looked for high levels of ambiguity, specifically the amount of ambiguous or “N” bases, which could suggest potential sequencing errors. Sequences with high amounts of ambiguity, generally if greater than 10% of the whole genome, could require the samples to be re-examined and re-sequenced before being included in downstream analyses.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Whole Genome Sequences from Outbreak, Alignment Viewer\n\n\nMultiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Metrics of Sequences in Alignment Viewer.\nThe alignment file containing sequences from the outbreak aligned to the reference genome was analyzed in Alignment Viewer.

    "text": "17.1 Pairwise Distance Matrices\nA pairwise distance matrix is a table that quantifies the genetic differences between sequences by counting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPS are individual base differences at specific nucleotide posititions in the genome. It helps to determine how closely related two samples are and whether genetic clustering aligns with known epidemiological links.\nEach cell in the matrix represents the number of SNP differences between a pair of genome sequences. The smaller the number, the more similar the sequences are. A value of 0 means the sequences are identical.\nComputing pairwise distance matrices is a relatively straightfoward process with several steps. First the sequence are aligned (or arranged to where the sequences line up together). In this case, each viral genome would be aligned to the reference genome to detect differences in nucleotide positions. Next, one would count the SNP differences. Each genome is compared and the number of nucleotide differences are counted. This produces a matrix where row = column (since sequence A vs B is the same as B vs A). Lastly, heatmaps can be generated from the matrices to give a visual representation using a color scheme.\nExample illustrating a Pairwise Distance Matrix This pairwise distance compares the number of mutation differences between two sequences. For example, the number of mutation difference, also known as the genetic distance, between Sequence A and the reference sequence is 0, meaning that the sequences are identical and possess no differences in mutations. However, Sequence D has a genetic distance of 3 when compared to the reference sequence, meaning that there are 3 mutations not shared between the two sequences. As such, Sequence A is more closely related to the reference than Sequence D. In terms of tracing how the virus spreads or its transmission, it is likely that the reference and Sequence A belong to the same transmission chain than that of the reference and Sequence D.\n“I see now, thank you so much! That makes sense.” Smiled the Local Health Jurisdiction Epidemiologist.\nAnother Molecular Epidemiologist chimed in, “I am happy to explain phylogenetic trees!”",

    "section": "17.2 Phylogenetic Trees",
    "text": "17.2 Phylogenetic Trees\nA phylogenetic tree is a hierarchical clustering or branching diagram that represents the evolutionary relationships between sequences based on genetic similarity. In this outbreak investigation, the tree helps determine how closely related viral genomes are across different individuals and species. Think of it as a family tree where we can trace the ancestry of a virus.\nEach tip (or leaf) on the tree represents a sample’s genome sequence of the virus. The branches connecting them indicate evolutionary relationships, or the sharing of a common ancestor, and branch length represent the amount of genetic difference between sequences.\nWhen interpreting trees, there’s so much to consider! Yet, let’s keep it simple and expand on the concept of a “family tree” with sequences being “closely related”. Samples that are closer together along the x-axis being more genetically similar and genetically related to each other. Shorter branch lengths indicate fewer genetic differences between sequences, meaning that there’s less mutations between the sequences and they share a more recent common ancestor. However, longer branches means an accumulation of more mutations. As such, this would mean that the sequences are less closely related or are distantly related. Identical sequences would occur along the same x-axis but would be stacked vertically on the y-axis for visibility.\nExample illustrating phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment Imagine this tree to represent viral sequences of pathogen X. This phylogenetic tree uses a type of algorithm called “Neighbor-Joining” to cluster the sequences based on genetic similarities. In other words, this Neighbor-Joining tree illustrates the similarity among sequences based on their nucleotide differences, with Seq A serving as a stand-in for the reference since it is identical to it. Starting from Seq A, the tree shows that Seq B is the most similar sequence, differing by only one mutation, suggesting it was the earliest to diverge from the reference. Seq E branches off next; although it has two mutations relative to the reference, it shares key differences with the more diverged sequences. The most closely related pair in the dataset is Seq C and Seq D, which differ from each other by just a single mutation and share additional differences not found in the other sequences. This pattern suggests they share a recent common ancestor and in terms of epidemiological context this may represent part of a localized transmission cluster.\nIt’s important to keep in mind caveats and limitations when interpreting phylogenetic trees. For example, while this tree reflects patterns of similarity rather than explicit evolutionary history, its structure can still offer insights into possible transmission relationships, particularly if sequences that are genetically similar were also sampled close together in time and space. However, because Neighbor-Joining does not reconstruct mutation order or directionality, it cannot by itself establish who infected whom or infer precise chains of transmission without incorporating additional epidemiological data.\n          ┌── Seq D\n      ┌───┤\n      │   └── Seq C\n  ┌───┤\n  │   └── Seq E\n──┤\n│ └── Seq B\n└──── Seq A\n\n“I see now” said the Local Health Jursidiction Epidemiologist. “Thank you so much for explaining! I imagine the process to generate the trees requires some form of computation?”\n“Absolutely!” cheered the Molecular Epidemiologist. I’m happy to explain that as well.\n\n17.2.1 Generating Phylogenetic Trees\nOnce the genome sequences are aligned and mutations identified, the next step is to construct a phylogenetic tree, a visual representation of their evolutionary relationships.\nThe first step in building the tree is to calculate genetic distances—essentially counting how many nucleotide differences separated each sequence. Viral sequences that shared fewer mutations are likely part of the same transmission chain, while those with more mutations were more genetically distinct.\nTo translate these genetic distances into a tree, we can use computational clustering algorithms that groups sequences based on similarity. The general process follows these steps: First we generate our sequence alignment in which all genome sequences were compared letter by letter to pinpoint mutations. Next we compute our distance matrix in which the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating each pair of sequences is counted. This would generate a pairwise distance matrix that quantified genetic differences between samples.\nAfterwards, a tree would be constructed using a clustering algorithm. There’s quite a few different clustering algorithm, but what they do is group sequences that are genetically similar into clusters, forming a branching structure - a sort of family tree.\nThe final tree would reveal key insights about the outbreak. “Given the outbreak, if sequences from the muubats and infected trainers clustered closely together, it would provide strong evidence of spillover from animals to humans” explained one of the Molecular Epidemiologist. “Alternatively, if human sequences showed signs of divergence, it might suggest ongoing transmission within the human population”, they continued.",

The x-axis represents divergence (also sometimes referred to as genetic distance, or the number of mutations from the reference genome). To give an example, the reference genome is 5000 bases long, so a divergence of 0.0006 would mean 3 mutations difference. (5000 * 0.0006).\nNote that identical sequences like muubat_02, muubat_03, and muubat_04 lie on the same x-axis and are stacked vertically.
