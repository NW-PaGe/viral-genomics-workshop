The newest attraction of fruits bats includes the muubat, one of the friendliest and meek bat species to interact with. In December of 2030, Fuchsia City brought in a four muubats to be trained and then integrated into the Safari Zone. Many of the residents and tourists alike were very excited to meet the muubats. To garner attention to the newest attraction, Fuchsia City advertised that the muubats should be fully integrated into the Safari Zone by the summertime.",

    "text": "2.2 Standard Protocol:\nAny new animal that has been chosen to be integrated into the Safari Zone must undergo certain testing, training, and other procedures before being integrated into the wild. Unfortunately, the risks with muubats, like all bat species, is that they tend to harbor many different viral diseases that cause nasty infections in humans. It is protocol when introducing new bat species, as well as many other animal species, to test the animal for any known diseases, both bacterial and viral, that could cause spillover into humans and the other animals. Oftentimes the presence of a microorganism in an animal is confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, which detects the presence of different microbes that can cause disease. As the advent of whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and its utility is very much new to the city’s surveillance methods, work is still ongoing to be able to detect novel pathogens which have not been previously encountered before.",

    "text": "2.3 Testing the muubats:\nAs soon as the muubats arrive to the facility they are physically examined and tested. Blood samples and swab samples are taken per individual bat, and are subjected to bacterial culture, and a pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel. Culture from blood samples generally takes 48 to 72 hours, and according to the results, none of the blood samples from any of the four bats produced viable colonies. Any leftover blood samples were stored for potential future uses. For the swab samples, genetic material is extracted from the swabs, and then prepped for sequencing. The turn-around time for sequencing to bioinformatics takes about a week and a half. The muubats are kept in an isolated environment interacting only with the trainers during their time in quarantine. It is protocol to obtain enough swab samples for which the extracts could be stored, so both additional and leftover extracts were stored in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer for potential future uses. After a week and a half, the taxonomic identification results from the pathogen-agnostic sequencing panel came back negative, indicating that none of the bats carried any known pathogens that caused infections in humans. With testing and sequencing indicating that the muubats appeared to be clear and healthy, the fruit bats were then relocated to another facility area to begin training.",

    "text": "Pathogen Genomics is a new and revolutionary field in Public Health and it represents a new direction of infectious disease intelligence and surveillance. What we have accomplished during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects this.\nThe sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed surveillance and epidemiologic analyses. This learning experience has ushered us in a new direction of infectious disease intelligence and surveillance, where pathogen genomes can be used for more insightful analyses like phylodynamics, transmission dynamics, variant detection, estimating disease severity, among other things. From this experience, there’s ample opportunity and room to expand sequencing and genomics to other pathogens of notifiable conditions.\nIn the future, once we are more established in this field, we can begin to build a global warning system for future pandemics of emerging pathogens. In a sense, we do a lot of this kind of work right now with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, all that we do now and the work that we invest in will serve as a model for the ways in which we can monitor, prevent, and control infectious diseases and it’s looking to be a very optimistic future direction.\nThis story is meant to help build capacity in Pathogen Genomics, whether you are a laboratorian, epidemiologist, bioinformatician, infectious disease specialist, and the like. Furthermore, this mystery outbreak story is an ode to all of the public health professionals, researchers, scientists, and healthcare workers that worked tirelessly on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the newcomers who are interested in this area. We seek to revolutionalize our surveillance systems and infrastructure, and you too, can be a part of this undertaking.\n\nSteph M Lunn\n\nHave questions?
